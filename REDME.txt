EXECUTION
*Upload dataset into hdf than insert it into table.
 (I done it with Ambari Hive View Upload Table.)
*Partitioning table with partitions and use it table for executioning 1.2 and 1.3 tasks.
*Change execution engine in Hive View setings betwin tez and mr to compare result and execution time.
If you want execute queries on spark engine, you will execut it on Zeppelin noutebook,
because you cant set spar like executin engine in settings of Ambari Hive View. 

All queries in file 1.txt 
All screenshots and results in folders 1.1-1.4
Also screenshots can be something like a guid, how to run queries.
